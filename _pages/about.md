Hi, I'm **Huangyi Tang**.

I'm a researcher at **Purdue University**. I build tools for data quality control and breeding analytics, mainly with R and Shiny.

**Code & projects**

You can find my open-source work on GitHub: [**@Thymine2001**](https://github.com/Thymine2001). Highlights include:

- **[easybreedeR](https://github.com/rojaslabteam-rgb/easybreedeR)** — R-Shiny app for rapid QC, visualization, and preparation of breeding data (phenotypes, pedigrees, genotypes)
- **[dataprevieweR](https://github.com/Thymine2001/dataprevieweR)** — Interactive R Shiny app for quick data preview and QC
- **[pedivieweR](https://github.com/Thymine2001/pedivieweR)** — Shiny app for viewing and analyzing pedigree data with network visualization
- **[easyblup](https://github.com/Thymine2001/easyblup)** — Helper for generating parameter files for blupf90
